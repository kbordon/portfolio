              <p class="about">My name as you might've inferred from the giant header on every page is Kimberly Bordon, though I prefer just "Kim."</p>
              <p class="about">I was born and raised in San Diego, and I lived there until just about 2011. Since then, I've lived in a few places in the Bay Area (of California, if that's needed to specify.) Now, I'm here in Portland, and have been for a little over three years nows, but who knows how long that will last.</p>
