                <p class="about">You'd like to know about me, eh? Well, I'd assume so since you're here. Even if you somehow wandered in by mistake, that's alright! It's a rather short story anyway.</p>

                <p class="about">Over the course of my life, I've in a few places along the west coast:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li><span class="cities">San Diego</span> (birth - 2011) in various neighborhoods</li>
                  <li><span class="cities">Pacifica and Daly City</span> (2011 - 2013) both in the Bay Area </li>
                  <li><span class="cities">Portland</span> (2013 - present)</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I finished a B.A. in Japanese Studies many many years ago, mostly at that point to just get a degree. In retrospect, I would've liked to take a break before high school rather than rushing into university, but hindsight is just that.</p>
                <p>Since graduating, I've tried to return to school for second bachelor's or a master's in mind while making a living as a barista. It hasn't exactly been the easiest, but at the very least, I feel my ability to create microfoam is quite adequate.</p>
                <p>As much as I love not having to pay more than $5 for 12 oz latte whenever I want, being a barista is, at least for me, not the fulfilling job.</p>
                <p>Epicodus appealed to me because of that focus on people like me, looking for change and eager to learn about something new.</p>
